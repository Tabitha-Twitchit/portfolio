        <p>Tabitha Nikolai is an artist, designer, and educator. She makes art games and interactive digital experiences that trouble the impact of virtual experiences on physical life. She likes jank because that's where the good stuff is--that which is human within systems otherwise leveraged for frictionless extraction. Video games she has worked on are all freely available on her <a href="https://tabithanikolai.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io page.</a> For the time being she is still on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tabby_twitchit/" target="_blank"> nstagram</a> but hopes not to be soon. A ledger of her work related struggles and joys is maintained below for your assessment and perverse curiosity.</p>
